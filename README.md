DropDown is a top-down screenswiper game where the player is a dot that can be controlled with key presses. The player's dot begins in the middle of the screen
on a middle level. Levels continuosly move from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen. If you cannot navigate the ball quick enough, the levels will 
bring your ball towards the top of the screen as they move up. If the player's ball touches the top of the screen, they lose. The objective of the game is to last
as long as possible and to beat previous scores
